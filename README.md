# shiny-bird-classifier
A shiny application for classifying species of bird

This app has been designed to classify the species of an input bird image according to the species in the CUB200-2011 dataset. 
In a World where there is a growing need for clean renewable energy, a huge issue we face is avian mortality around wind farms. A relatively small body of research in the growing computer vision literature is the detection and classification of avian species around wind farms. If successful, such a system could automate the design of wind farms to reduce collision-related fatalaties. 
The functional use of the classifier is to allow prospective systems engineers to automatically generate predictions for their collated data. 

The current version of the app supports several pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks from seminal papers in computer vision. The user is able to tab through these models to generate predictive probabilities for the input image belonging to one of 200 species of avian wildlife.
